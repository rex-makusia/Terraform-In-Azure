# Deploying Infrastructure with Terraform in Azure

# Description
Terraform is an infrastructure automation tool that allows companies to manage infrastructure through code. This provides many benefits such as greater recovery, predictability, and speed. 
Infrastructure as code is quickly becoming a standard for managing cloud resources and is widely practiced among the top high performing companies. One of the major benefits of using Terraform over other infrastructure as code tools is that its platform agnostic. 
Terraform can be used to manage any major Cloud Service Provider as well as on-prem environments using vSphere and Cisco. Teams can use the same adopted skillset and workflows to manage other environments instead of reinventing the wheel for managing each environment. 
Terraform is also simple to learn in a matter of a few days and can be quickly adopted as a way to manage infrastructure among teams.

In this lab, you will create a Terraform configuration to deploy a Virtual Network in Azure.
